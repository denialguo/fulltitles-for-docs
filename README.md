Google Docs only shows one line for document titles on the homepage â€” which means your filenames get cut off right when they start getting useful.

FullTitles expands each document title to two lines and adds a clean, readable tooltip when it's still too long.

ðŸ”¹ Two-line titles with smart wrapping
ðŸ”¹ Custom tooltip on hover
ðŸ”¹ Maintains grid alignment
ðŸ”¹ Fast, lightweight, no setup required

Ideal for anyone who names their files clearly and wants to read them.
